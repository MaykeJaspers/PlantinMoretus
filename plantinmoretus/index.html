          <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
          <p>In the quiet village of Saint-Avertin near Tours, France, a boy named Christoph Plantin is born. Surrounded
            by the lush countryside, little does anyone suspect that this boy will one day revolutionize the world of
            printing. His early years are spent learning from the skilled artisans in the region, a subtle hint of the
            craftsmanship that would define his life.</p>

          <p>As a young man, Christoph begins his apprenticeship in bookbinding and leatherworking. Day by day, his
            hands become skilled, his eyes sharp, and his mind disciplined. The long hours of meticulous work teach him
            not only patience but also the value of precision—traits that will serve him well in the world of books and
            printing.</p>

            team—Jeanne’s unwavering support allows Christoph to focus on perfecting his craft and dreaming of a greater
            future. Their bond is one of quiet determination, laying the foundation for the family legacy to come.</p>
